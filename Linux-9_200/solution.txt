Let's get root so we can have free reign inside our VM!

First, boot up a live CD.
Then:
>> mkdir mnt
>> sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 mnt
>> vi /etc/sudoers

Uncomment the line that says " %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL"
Since the cs user is a member of the wheel group, this is all we need to gain
sudo access.

Boot back into the VM, and run `sudo su` with your password cctf.
Now, we can access the /home/flag/flag.txt

>> cat /home/flag/flag.txt
{r00t_0nlY}
