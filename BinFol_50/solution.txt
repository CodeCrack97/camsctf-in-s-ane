First, let's sort the folders numerically.

We know the flag has to begin with '{', so let's look at the binary
representation of this character: 01111011.

Now let's look for a pattern in the folder names. We first notice the chain for
four '1's in the binary representation, and we also notice that there is a chain
of folders 1,2,3,4 before a folder is missing in the numerical order. We then
notice that when a folder in the numerical order exists, there is a 1, and when
a file does not exist, there is a 0. We can assume that the folders are supposed
to start at 0, signifying a zero bit in the binary representation of the flag.
Now, we just write up a python script to generate the binary string, and we can
then just convert the binary to a string:

{0NE_ZER0_0NE}
