At first we are presented with a standard HTTP Authorization. When canceling the sending of a proper authorization, we get to a page that tells us that they're getting one row and checking that it only returns one row. Typical SQL injection.

So let's simply give an SQL injection as the username and leave the password blank, while limiting the rows returned as 1.

curl --user "' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 -- '": http://web.camsctf.com/a/
