first you suspect it's a bar code, so you check for non-white pixels, then you
realize that nothing is white... so you floodfill the (254, 254, 254) ones as
black, then you realize that the remaining pixels are quite peculiar. On row 42,
from pixel 0 to pixel 43, the values are all either 254 or 255... very
interesting. So you put that in a script, assume it's binary, and the result is 
011110110101000001001001010011000110110001101111011101110101111101000110011010010100011101101000010101000111110100000000000000000

which translates to:
{PILlow_FiGhT} with a bunch of nulls
