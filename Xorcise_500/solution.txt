Literally the bashiest solution of all time. So after playing around with the
evil binary you realize that the gen_key function generates a correct seriel
based on the first 5 letters of the seriel you put in.

This seems to be pretty bashable, so let's do it.

First we need an executable gdb file, which will be produced by bashXorGen.py.
The actual generated file is HUGE, so i'm not going to push it here, but the
idea is basically run over and over again with all possible seriel starters.

Then you just

gdb ./evil -x xorBash | grep "JW9CI"

Which, after about 10-15-20 minutes (i was afk) it'll give you the flag:

ABARR-P7M95-R8CEQ-WC6V9-JW9CI
