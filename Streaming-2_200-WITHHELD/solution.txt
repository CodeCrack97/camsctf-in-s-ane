First, we'll use WinRAR to extract `secret2.docx` from `secret2.rar`
We specify the -os flag to tell WinRAR to preserve NTFS streams.

>"C:\Program Files\WinRAR\Rar.exe" -os x secret2.rar

Next we'll list the directory with the /r flag to find the names of alternate
data stream files.
> dir /r

Now we'll get a LONG list of embedded files in secret2.docx with the naming
pattern flag{number}.txt where 0 <= number <= 4820.

Since we don't want to read the contents of each file manually, we'll write a
batch script to do this for us. (see solve.bat)

Running solve.bat will reveal that flag4241.txt is different from the rest and
contains the flag:
{MaSteR_0f_AlT_sTrEaMs}
