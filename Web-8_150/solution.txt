Inspecting the javascript code, we learn that the password is of length 12 and
the encrypted data is XORed with the password block-wise. All we have to do is
guess the password! We see that the decrypted data is eval()'d, so we can assume
that the decrypted data starts with console.log(). Wait, how is long is that?!
"console.log(" is 12 characters! Let's reverse engineer the password! Since the
decryption algorithm is just an XOR of the password with each number in the
array, we can reverse this by performing an XOR of each array element with the
corresponding letter in "console.log(". See the comments in web8.js for the
results. Then, we just need to simulate keypresses (made easy by jQuery).

Dumping the keypress simulation code into the console of the page for Web 8
gives us the flag!
