First we decompress all the streams in the pdf
> qpdf --stream-data=uncompress Anonymous.pdf out.pdf

Next we extract all the docx elements from the pdf using binwalk's built in extraction
> binwalk -e out.pdf

Let's take a look at the extraction...
> cd _out.pdf.extracted

Now we combine everything together into a docx, but after we remove the useless *.zlib and *.zip files
> rm -f *.zlib *.zip
> zip -r secret.docx *

Inside secret.docx, the footer has a link to https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8dGaC-LKWUc0JXNTctc29jSFU
                    the header has a string d4760721c2573778fdaadfa567cd3d6d

When you visit the google drive link, you are faced with a file =).txt.cpt
Upon doing some research, we came across the ccrypt utility and download it to decrypt the message.

Initially I tried the string as the decryption key and its hex-decoded string as the key, but that didn't work. But then I realized that it might've been a hash that we were given. So I simply searched in a rainbow table and there it was, the key: http://md5hashing.net/search/all/d4760721c2573778fdaadfa567cd3d6d?is_search=true#main

> ./ccrypt -d -c -K l0rdh3l1x \=\).txt.cpt
