"News that some mediocre-guy is becoming popular has been tumbling around lately. Tag along with the crowd and check out his blog."

The major hints in the problem are the puns using "tumbling" and "tag along."
Clearly, we should find mediocre-guy's tumblr, which isn't too hard to find with
a quick Google search. We can verify this is right by the bio, which tells us he
is a student at CAMS. Now, we have to find the flag by leveraging tumblr's tags.
So let's do a tag search for flag:
http://mediocre-guy.tumblr.com/tagged/flag
The first post is this, which contains two images, with one of them being
transparent so as to be difficult to read. The flag is the second image.:
