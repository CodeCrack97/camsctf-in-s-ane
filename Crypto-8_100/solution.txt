Looking at the ciphertext, I figured it resembled a transposition of some sort.
Clearly, it's some type of simple cipher, so I went on
http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/ and just went down the line of ciphers, sticking
the ciphertext into each one. When I got to Rotate, I just dumped the ciphertext
into the text box and started counting up from 1 for the box width. Literally as
I was doing this, I started wondering: "What if they just gave us a number in the
problem and just told us to use it, in case we needed it." As soon as that
thought passed my mind, the flag flashed in front of my eyes.

Rotate Cipher
Box Width: 14
