The problem states:
"Find the message. There may or may not be a passphrase."

Since we're given an MP3 file, let's find a program that performs steganography
on MP3 files and supports encrypting with a passphrase. A quick Google search
shows that MP3Stego is a popular tool that is available on Windows.

Let's download it and try to find any hidden messages in our MP3 file!
The problem description states that there may or may not be a passphrase.
Hopefully, there isn't, or else we'll have to brute force the password!
Scripting on Windows? Oh no!

We `cd` into `MP3Stego_1_1_18/MP3Stego/` and just run the command: `Decode -X steg2.mp3`
and enter in nothing as the passphrase. After a few seconds, we should have our
steg2.mp3.txt which contains the flag:

{mp3_st3g_s0_c00l}
