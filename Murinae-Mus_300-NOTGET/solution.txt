When we open the pcap file in Wireshark, we notice that it's a lot of USB data being transferred from the client (USB Device) and host (Computer). From the problem name, Murinae Mus, we assume that it has something to do with the signals from a computer mouse. Also looking at the first few exchanges, we see that the USB Controller recognizes a Logitech device.

After the identification exchange, we see a lot of USB_INTERRUPT_IN which is control data sent from the mouse to the computer. Let's extract all of this data:
> tshark -r murinae_mus.pcap -T fields -e usb.capdata > usb_data.txt
> tshark -r murinae_mus.pcap -t dd > usb_time_deltas.txt

Then we can take all the instances for when the mouse was "clicked" which is when the the first set of bytes is 01 or 02.
Decoding this as binary where the left mouse click is 0 and the right mouse click is 1, we get the flag

Flag: {cl1ck_c1ick}
