Linux is a very libre operating system. What does CSC's presentation say about it?
Hint: In March 2014, a very important CEO of Desolate Games made an excellent video on Linux.

From the hint, we get to the page http://www.desolategames.com/updates, where we find that the CEO is Oskar. Finding him on Github leads us to https://github.com/oskarwirga
Looking as what Oskar has contributed to, we find that he is part of CSC (DUHH).

And where do you find videos? Youtube! So finding CSC on Youtube leads us to https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBoN66yEu3Bm4UYvlvT3KMQ/videos

We see a video on the introduction to Linux and it was posted on March 2014. Bingo.
