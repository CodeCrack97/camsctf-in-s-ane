First we get what kind of memory image we're dealing with... turns out it's windows
./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw imageinfo > imageinfo.txt

Then we get the processes that are running. The two that we focus on are the virus.exe (PID 776) and firefox.exe (PID 2656)
./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw pslist > pslist.txt

1. ./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw cmdscan > cmdscan.txt or ./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw consoles > consoles.txt
    Cmd #2 @ 0x5029f0: net user Administrator u_g0t_hacked_trolololoLOL

    Solution: u_g0t_hacked_trolololoLOL

2. ./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw memdump -p 776 --dump-dir .
   Then `strings 776.dmp` and the first thing that looks like a "flag":

    Solution: going_viral...not_really

3. mkdir files; ./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw dumpfiles -p 2656 --dump-dir files > dumpfiles.txt
   From one of the dumps we get that the email is eleethaxzorz314
   We also extracted the key3.db and login.json. Then opening these in Firefox or any password viewer, we get the password of the gmail account.

    Solution: F8Zht8G752CszF

We submitted:
u_g0t_hacked_trolololoLOL, going_viral...not_really, F8Zht8G752CszF


We also got screenshots of gui in the memory for fun.
mkdir screenshots; ./volatility_2.4_x64 -f memory.raw screenshots --dump-dir screenshots
