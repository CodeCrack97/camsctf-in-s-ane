If we look at the impossible_salt.py script we are given, we notice that the A
in SALT is replaced with a unicode capitalized alpha. As a result, python throws
a hissy fit when we try to run the program. Let's just rename SÎ‘LT to S4LT. Now,
if we inspect the algorithm, we'll notice that S4LT is the result of the
concatenation of SALT and a random number between 0 and 9. Therefore, there are
only 10 different salts! Let's run the program and try them all.
When we get to the salt:
efe855d8ae760f3f49445fd2eb4e718c751d6596900ec1b6dc6c6798b415aa9894f9a92739f5d70bce44c820781c9f75860552165002c09433ddd5fb124bd807
We get the filename:
1d039f52c3d7f5b4919f6806bd377d5044cce17b1da01ac6ec

which contains the flag:
{lol_unic0de_l0l}
